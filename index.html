                    <p> ... with the finals. You're almost there, beautiful. I know you're tired and stressed and all that, but you're a hard worker and you'll get through this. I know you will. I'm so proud of you.</p>
                    <p> As soon as you're done, you better sleep for 23 hours and watch lots of movies/do lots of activities with me!!!</p>
                    <p> I can't wait. Also, your designs are fucking incredible. I kid you not. They are so damn pretty it's unbelievable. How are you so talented???? I've always been proud of you but you don't realize the smile I had on my face when I looked at your design earlier today. You're truly remarkable. A genius.</p>
                    <p> I'm so proud. But you need a lot of rest right after this...</p>
                    <p> Can't wait to meet you soon!!!!!</p>
                    <p> Always stay pretty.</p>
                    <p> With love and passion.</p>

                    <p> ... soon. After January 20.</p>
                    <p> It seems you're right on schedule this time!!! You have no words how proud and happy I feel to know this. She will get time to sleep even during the deadline day (hopefully!!!). She will successfully complete the finals.</p>
                    <p> Thank you for opening up to me about some things again, today. Means a lot to me that you feel comfortable to be very transparent with me. I appreciate that a lot. Take notes everyone, this is how a person you want to live together for the rest of your life with should be. Pristine, honest, smart, pretty, Hani.</p>
                    <p> I'm so excited to see you again, beautiful. So many things await us. Very excited I am.</p>
                    <p> Always stay pretty.</p>

                    <p> I will love you the same regardless of whether you feel miserable or like the happiest person in the world. I'm not sure if I was able to help you out enough when you were in that state earlier today, but I'm so glad I stayed with you until you calmed down, even if just a little bit.</br>Let's talk a lot more about things from here onwards as well, ne. You're so strong.</p>
                    <p> Life is strange, but it's funny how nothing really matters, and that's why love feels so sweet to me. I like to look at life almost as "in the moment" thing because I think that's just what it is in the grand scheme of things, so I enjoy it a lot. Can I enjoy it a lot with you?</p>
                    <p> I still haven't received the visa approval from the ECT government when the website said it'd take around 3 business days... it's been more than 7 business days lol. Just gotta wait and see, I guess.</p>
                    <p> Anyways, I'm so excited to see you again, beautiful.</p>
                    <p> Always stay pretty.</p>
                    <p> With love and passion.</p>

                    <p> Congrats, gay girl. Super proud of you for the hard work. I'm looking at you right now and my goodness you look smoking hot...</br>Maybe I'm ovulating. Is it possible to ovulate every day? Maybe for guys in love.</p>
                    <p> Full marks in the written exam? That's crazy. You're smart at everything, goddamn it.</p>
                    <p> Didn't do much today but thought about you a lot... miss you...</p>

                    <p> A very busy day today, but I've been feeling this warmth inside me throughout the day because I believe we've crossed yet another milestone together. You have given me all the strength and made me stronger to keep going. I'm so proud of us, and I want us to keep going. I would love to. Can we please continue being important parts of each other from here as well?</br>...can't imagine being out here without you...</p>
                    <p> Slightly worried that I haven't gotten response from you for the past few hours. I hope I didn't make you mad. If some action of mine has made you behave this way, I'm really sorry and I didn't mean to make you mad. Are you doing okay? Have you had your dinner? Have you felt the same warmth that I have been feeling today? Or has it been hurting all day because of my action(s) that I'm not currently aware of? I want to talk to you... just want to see your face at least to know that you're doing okay. Is that too much to ask for? Sorry for being selfish when you're stressed beyond words due to your finals...</p>
                    <p> I know you're stressed because of the finals, but you're almost there... almost there beautiful. I'm right here supporting you and will always be your listener. Always here, doing anything I can if that means I can help you -- make you happy. That's all I want. All I've ever wanted...</p>
                    <p> I don't wanna say it kinds hurts but it feels... worrisome sometimes when you're gone. But I can only hope that you're doing well, eating well, taking care of yourself... even if you're stressed.</p>
                    <p> I miss you so much.</p>
                    <p> 1 month feels so long...</p>

                    <p> ... since we decided to take ourselves one step further. 23 months in and I've learned so much to appreciate myself, other people around me, and have become a much better person. All because of you. Am I making you happy enough, I wonder? I really want to because I love you so much. Thank you so much for being so patient with me, always.</p>
                    <p> I wish I could give you flowers. I miss giving you flowers. I can barely gift you anything physical, it sucks man. Sucks that I can't hold you in my arms. But that's okay, I'll be there soon!</p>
                    <p> I'm so excited to see you again, beautiful. Happy (almost) monthly anniversary to us.</p>

                    <p> ... but proud of you because you've been super productive today! See? You'll comfortably finish your finals before the deadline.</p>
                    <p> You were already done with 3 of them earlier today... hoping you've finished 3 more by now! Regardless of whether you've finished enough or not though, you've still worked so damn hard today and I want you to be proud of yourself. I can't be the only one always being proud. Sometimes, nothing else matters when you don't feel good about yourself -- even if you're getting appreciated by others. Hope you're treating yourself well.</p>
                    <p> Didn't really do much today tbh... kinda feel shitty because I haven't done much and also because I miss you...</br>Patiently waiting for the day I can watch movies, play geoguessr, and do other activities with you...</p>
                    <p> So damn excited to see you again, beautiful. Exactly 1 month from now, I'll be there!</p>

                    <p> But not so tiring after I got to see your face before I went to sleep. Thursdays are always pretty shit for me because of the dead class I have to teach at the end, but I felt good today because I was so happy to see you happy.</p>
                    <p> Sleeping early is nice, isn't it. Hope you get enough sleep and hope we keep getting enough sleep from here. Let's build a habit ne.</p>
                    <p> Still waiting for that ECT visa approval; hopefully it gets done by the start of next week. One can hope.</p>
                    <p> Once Friday's classes are done, I will be such a free bird for the following 4 days! I think I'll just roam around aimlessly and think of what I wanna do with you when I'm there. Exciting times.</p>
                    <p> You're working so hard, and I'm super proud of you beautitul. Keep going.</p>

                    <p> Feeling sick is never a nice thing, and while I feel sad that I'm so far away from you as you go through it, I am glad that you are still making sure you are doing your best to eat properly. Stressful times, love, but you are strong and I will always be here for you, supporting you in any way I possibly can.</p>

                    <p> Finals, huh. I know you're under incredible amount of stress, but fear not, I've got just the perfect reward for you, love. It's stressful because it's supposed to be stressful! If it's not giving you a hard time, it's not worth it you know! And I know you got this. You always do.</p>
                    <p> And yep, ticket should be booked today. Hopefully by the time you read this. Ask me if I have or not when you see this ne.</p>
                    <p> I'm so excited to see you again, beautiful. I'm so excited. More than you belive. Don't you dare run away.</p>
                    <p> Always stay pretty.</p>

                    <p> Stop using others "being better" as an excuse to degrade yourself. Literally any reason you can use to degrade yourself works for you, eh? Seriously though, keep leeching off of others and multiplying your skillsets. That'll help a lot. Better remember what I said earlier and keep going!</p>
                    <p> It's gonna be a lovely day tomorrow and throughout February! We're gonna wrap up the booking and we're gonna do that good. ECT zone, I will be in you soon.</p>
                    <p> You're working hardest you've ever worked in your life, and you're getting better every day. Always compare yourself with the you from yesterday (or a week ago, or a month ago, or a year ago) and ask yourself: "Have I gotten better? Have I improved?", and if the answer is yes, then great! If it's a no, then you gotta work on knowing more than you did before! Just how it works.</p>
                    <p> You're a hard worker, so all you need is to believe in yourself, beautiful. I have full confidence in you. You'll be better. You'll be way better. Never stop.</p>
                    <p> Always stay pretty.</p>

                    <p> New year. New resolutions to improve our healths and protect each other: one step at a time. I feel so great to have had this conversation with you.</p>
                    <p> So, what do we have? Starting with a 30-day commitment, are we? I'm going to make this website my commitment tracker by commenting each day about my discipline, holding myself accountable.</p>
                    <p> 3 meals a day and falling asleep by 1 AM. Let's do our best for the first month before we decide to up the scale, shall we? I feel rejuvenated for some reason. I feel like we're going to work towards bettering ourselves and each other -- both concurrently -- with this.</p>
                    <p> Btw I've been looking at the PDF with your mid-term assignment presentation slides repeatedly because... man they're breathtaking. You may not like them too much given your exceedingly high standards but for a straight dork like me who sees colors mixed and gets excited, I thought those designs AND the way you crafted the slides were super phenomenal. You're an amazing creator, you know.</p>
                    <p> Let's talk more about my Feb trip tomorrow and beyond ne. I'm so excited by all this.</p>
                    <p> Btw please try to get more irons in your body than necessary during your period... give your body a little more care than usual ne. Please.</p>

                    <p> So here's this pretty lady who said she'd take up a conventional topic and undero creative craft in it, and she actually ended up doing it!</p>
                    <p> I run out of words sometimes. You create such beautiful designs, beautiful. And I know I don't know the technicalities of it, and here's what I have to say to that: I don't need to! Your designs are just breathtaking to me. You're cool. Super cool. Coolest woman in my life.</p>
                    <p> Very excited to discuss the Viet trip with you tomorrow by the way!</p>
                    <p> I'm so proud of you, love. I'm so proud. I know you've been told this numerous times already but you're so talented and hardworking. I'm so proud of you.</p>
                    <p> Hope you have a lovely sleep again tonight, since that's what a beautiful hardworking lady deserves.</p>

                    <p> I'm feeling more lonely than usual today. I don't know why, but I just am. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not feeling well or because I'm just missing you. Jk, it is the latter.</p>
                    <p> I thought I'd be super productive today, but I started looking up apartments and couldn't get anything notable done until I stopped it and started practicing some Python. Damn, it seems like I've forgotten quite a bit of Python too. It's not looking good...</p>
                    <p> This only means I'm gonna have to go caveman mode and put in hours to improve my skillset again. There's you working your ass off every day and getting better every day, so I have zero excuse for myself. I'm going to be an intermediate Python programmer by the end of March, I swear.</p>
                    <p> Feel frustrated with myself today, and feel quite sad as well and nothing of note has even happened today for me to feel this down; I think I just miss you a lot. Save me, sunshine...</p>
                    <p> Anyway, I bet you're on it like crazy with the mid-term assignment! I know you'll finish it tonight. You definitely will. I'm so proud of you, love. Even when I feel demotivated and overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things I need to get better at, I remember how you took an unconventional route to pursue your passion and how hard you're working to better yourself (you even changed a whole country for it!) and it gives me a reason to sit my ass down, stop feeling shitty, and get back to bettering myself again.</br> You're an inspiration, beautiful.</p>
                    <p> Good luck with youe mid-term and everything else ne! I can't wait to talk to you later today!</p>
                    <p> Always stay pretty.</p>

                    <p> Remember going to the hills full of red torii gates in Kyoto a year ago? Yup, that's my best experience ever in Japan, and it was with you. I'm so lucky.</p>
                    <p> Let's go there again this year okay! I know we will because I will force you to come to Japan this year. We will also go to Beppu, hopefully this year or at least before the end of 2025. That's a promise.</p>
                    <p> Seeing your designs always makes me smile because I get reminded every time of your genuis and creativity (and I'm not saying this because I'm in love, it's a fact). You're so talented, all you need from here is self-confidence because you've got everything else.</p>
                    <p> What a lovely day it has been for me as I finally get to talk to you without any worries. Never want this to end...</p>
                    <p> Good luck with your mid-term prep ne ~ I know you'll finish it so I'm not really worried. Just proud and happy to have you by my side and always working hard to make yourself better. That's an incredible woman and she's mine.</p>
                    <p> I'm so excited to see you this February, beautiful. I'm so excited. </p>

                    <p> First and foremost, yes, I do wish to stay with this person for 2024 and 2025 and 2026 and 2027 and 2028 and 2029 and 2030 and 2031 and so many more years because she's my happiness and pride so I'll do anything to be with her. There's your answer. Take it and never question it again.</p>
                    <p> What a lovely year 2023 has been. Both of us are well within our passions and have made it through yet another year of happiness with each other and knowing each other more. Truly a blessing. Blessed and proud.</p>
                    <p> I know you have all your worries about being someone who gives me a hard time, but I promise you I have absolutely no qualms about your habits. Believe me, I've known you for a long time and I want us to improve each other, which means I'll do anything to make you better, whether it's physically or mentally or psychologically or whatever it is... I will be there. So shut your trap and trust this relationship, will you? .... That's my girl.</p>
                    <p> You've never been a bother to me, I hope you never forget this. If you've not been in the best condition of yours, you can always let me know and I'll be very understanding of it and will work towards mitigating that with you together. Tbh I'll know even if you don't tell me but please tell me so that it lifts loads off your chest too.</br>You shouldn't eat yourself alive worrying that you've annoyed me when I don't even feel that way, and how you can get rid of that is by telling me you're not in the best condition and it'll help you not feel so damn guilty because... I literally don't care about your guilt. How about we solve this together instead of you always victimizing yourself? Okay? That's my girl.</p>
                    <p> Anyway, I feel quite nostalgic thinking about our Kyoto trip and how fun it was. Let's go there again next yer, okay? We will be there.</p>
                    <p> 2023 has been a real treat for me, and I want you to be there for me across 2024 and more as well. Hope 2024 gives you a juicy nifty internship and I'm pretty sure you'll be an incredile designer as well. Let's also work towards our mental healths in 2024 okay! We got this.</p>
                    <p> Happy new year, darling.</p>

                    <p> Yea, it's been a year. Time flies quick, doesn't it? One year ago, we were just meeting up in this one famous city. I was half-dead because the ferry ride left much to be desired (aka it was shit).</br>One year later, I've made you do my design and captions all day and and ended up not appreciating how lucky I was. When will I learn, love...</p>
                    <p> We were at Namba at this very moment 1 year ago (by the time I'm writing this), eating takoyaki and roaming around. Crazy crazy nostalgia.</p>
                    <p> Anyway, enough of that. Your design seriously blew me away today, you know. I know I didn't properly appreciate you earlier so let me do that again here... You dedicated your whole day doing the design, choosing the color combinations best suited for me, finding illustrations, finding ways to make the typesetting as perfect as possible, and so many other technical tasks I don't even have ideas of. I don't know what, but I know you pushed yourself beyond your limit. You always have. Thank you, once again, for being you. That's the woman I've always admired and loved.</p>
                    <p> So here's the thing: I've typed all these darn things while not even being sure if they'll even send... but if you're reading this, then you just know the good heavens above want you to read this...</p>
                    <p> I miss you and want to be with you very soon. Take care and sleep soon ne.</p>

                    <p> Well well well, if it isn't the horror show again. You're not in it for the thrill, you're in it for the masochism. Somebody knows you too well!</p>
                    <p> So here's what happened today. I ended up buying two super expensive pairs of shoes for my parents without their permission and now they're absolutely over the moon. </br>Fuck consent sometimes fr... (not like that!)</p>
                    <p> I feel super proud at the moment for being able to buy them expensive ass things without worrying too much about things. I can't wait to do the same for you... You know what, I bet you already knew this but I really do love buying people things. Especially if I care for them (well, most of the times).</p>
                    <p> If you read this message, can you throw in some details regarding what you are required to do for your midterm exam? Don't make it too detailed, however. Just wanted to have a look. Good luck on that, by the way!</p>
                    <p> So at long last, I finally have a new passport and I couldn't be happier. Let's start planning for Viet Cong soon please!</p>
                    <p> I can't wait for Feb and for our future, love. Wanna buy you a lot of things. Take you to places. Make you feel reassured. Always here for you.</p>

                    <p> I think it's a good idea, and I think it's something we should work towards in 2 years, okay?</p>
                    <p> I'm still mesmerized by how hot you looked yesterday (not that you're not like that all the time but maybe I was ovulating yesterday, idk lol).</p>

                    <p> I was like: "Mom, this is bad." and she was like: "Oh, I'm sorry. I'll get you another one."</p>
                    <p> I was like: "No, it's okay. I'll drink it."</p>

                     <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Dec 31, 2023: Happy new year, my love</h3>
                    <p> My heart has not been very organized for the past few days, and I acknowledge that my attitudes must have brought you the biggest</p>
                    <p> migraine every haha. I dont't even know, what qualities do you even see in me to bear with this god complex flawful mtfer? I guess </p>
                    <p> love is blind, and I don't mind that teehee. I think you must have been drained by all the gatherings and meetings with your relatives</p>
                    <p> as well as staying with your father, and I'm so proud of you for handling all those with kindness. Hihi as expected from my Sumit. You</p>
                    <p> were so cool when you told me that you brought the biggest smiles to your parents' faces by spoiling them with expensive shoes. You are</p>
                    <p> always the kindess, most caring person I have ever met in my life</p>
                    <p> Life has not been the easiest on our relationship this year. We were busy with job-hunting, we were drained, we had our moments. Then decisions</p>
                    <p> were made. I left Japan to pursue my dream. Until now, I still wonder if it's the right decision for me, you and our relationship. But looking</p>
                    <p> at the works I managed to create just 2 months after attending classes, I think I can say that I am proud that I took the unconventional path.</p>
                    <p> But now, new concerns arise, I sometimes doubt the sustainability of our relationship. I am... a toxic girlfriend, Sumit. I think you might already</p>
                    <p> had the ideas of that. I only bring chaos to our relationship, and I am not an understanding person. I demand too much from you even though you always</p>
                    <p>try your best. Am I even the right person for you? You deserve a better one I fear. </p>
                    <p> 1 hour left until new year. I know you don't really care about new year haha, but happy new year, my baby. You have been, and always, a person I look up to</p>
                    <p> because of your humility, resilience & wishdom. I hope that 2024 treats you well, with fatass bonuses & a lot of recognition. I truly, geunuinely pray for that for you.</p>
                    <p> I really hope that our relationship will stay strong despites all the adversities & no matter what happens, we will always be there for each other and sort it out together.</p>
                    <p> So to end this small letter, I want to ask you 1 question: For 2024, do you still wish to continue walking together with this person, despite all her flaws?</p>
                    <p> Looking forward to talking to my baby soon <3.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Dec 26, 2023: Sumit was a family chef today</h3>
                    <p> Sumit didn't call me at all today because he was busy cooking for a whole village (JKKKKKKK).</p>
                    <p> Sumit, don't chu dare love any other women besides me and your mom, or else I will kill you.</p>
